## Helpful resources

Blynk Docs can be found [here](https://docs.blynk.io/en/). For this project to work you will need to create both a [template](https://docs.blynk.io/en/getting-started/template-quick-setup) and then add your argon as a device. This can be done through the [quickstart](https://docs.blynk.io/en/getting-started/what-do-i-need-to-blynk) or by clicking **New Template** in the template section of your dashboard (it’s the icon with the 9 dots).

You’ll also need to send data back and forth from your device to Blynk Cloud. The documentation on doing so is available [here](https://docs.blynk.io/en/getting-started/using-virtual-pins-to-control-physical-devices).

Finally, you’ll need to make sure you have an [event](https://docs.blynk.io/en/blynk.console/templates/events) set up for the push notifications. Make sure to [enable notifications](https://docs.blynk.io/en/blynk.console/templates/events/events-notification-settings) for this event. Information on using events can be found [here](https://docs.blynk.io/en/blynk-library-firmware-api/log-event) and [here](https://docs.blynk.io/en/blynk.console/templates/events/custom-events/events--how-to-log-events).
